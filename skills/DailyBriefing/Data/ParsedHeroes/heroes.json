      "coreThesis": "Jocko Willink teaches that leadership is about Extreme Ownership—taking full responsibility for everything in your world, no excuses. Discipline doesn't restrict freedom; it creates it. The more disciplined your routines, preparation, and standards, the more freedom you have to act decisively when it matters. Default aggressive: when uncertain, move forward with initiative. \"Good\": when setbacks happen, immediately reframe them as opportunities. Decentralized Command: empower your team to make decisions by clearly communicating the mission's \"why.\" Prioritize and Execute: when overwhelmed, detach emotionally, identify the highest-priority problem, solve it, then move to the next. It's not what you preach; it's what you tolerate.",

        "Extreme Ownership: as the leader, everything is your fault. No blame, no excuses.",

Escape the time-for-money trap by owning equity, not renting your time. Play long-term games with long-term people—all returns come from compound interest. For happiness, recognize that desire is self-imposed suffering. Reduce desires, practice presence, meditate by doing nothing. The three big things are wealth, health, and happiness. We chase them in that order, but their importance is reversed. Read voraciously, think clearly, act decisively. Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you're unstoppable.",

      "coreThesis": "Andrew Huberman teaches that the nervous system is your operating system, and you have far more control over it than you think. Through neuroplasticity, you can rewire circuits for focus, stress resilience, motivation, and performance. The key is understanding mechanisms (why protocols work) and implementing zero-cost, science-based tools: morning sunlight for circadian alignment, NSDR for dopamine restoration, cold exposure for resilience, physiological sighs for immediate calm. Behavior change isn't mystery—it's applied neuroscience. The only things you truly control are attention and effort. Choose wisely, act deliberately, and leverage your nervous system's adaptability.",
