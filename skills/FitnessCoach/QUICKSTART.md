You receive a Telegram message like:

```
☀️ Good morning Max!

🏃 TODAY'S WORKOUT
───────────────────────────────────────
🔵 Easy Aerobic Run
⏱️ 45 min
🫀 Heart Rate: 124-143 bpm
🕐 Suggested: 6:00 AM

📊 WHY THIS WORKOUT:
✅ Recovery: 81/100
📉 Training Load: optimal
📈 Phase: base (week 1)

💡 Reply "done" when complete, "skip" if resting, or "hard"/"easy" for feedback.
```

### 2. After Workout
Mark completion and provide feedback:

```bash
# Mark as completed
bun run ~/.claude/skills/FitnessCoach/CLI/prescribe.ts complete <workout_id>

# Rate difficulty
bun run ~/.claude/skills/FitnessCoach/CLI/prescribe.ts feedback <workout_id> perfect
bun run ~/.claude/skills/FitnessCoach/CLI/prescribe.ts feedback <workout_id> too_hard "Legs felt heavy"
bun run ~/.claude/skills/FitnessCoach/CLI/prescribe.ts feedback <workout_id> too_easy
```

## 🛠️ Manual Commands

### View Upcoming Workouts
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/FitnessCoach
bun run CLI/prescribe.ts upcoming 7
```

### Generate Prescription Manually
```bash
# For today
bun run CLI/prescribe.ts prescribe

# For specific date
bun run CLI/prescribe.ts prescribe --date 2026-01-30

# With Telegram notification
bun run CLI/prescribe.ts prescribe --notify
```

### Check System Status
```bash
# Verify LaunchAgent is loaded
launchctl list | grep fitness

# Check logs
cat /tmp/fitness-morning-prescription.log
cat /tmp/fitness-morning-prescription.err

# Run morning scheduler manually (for testing)
bun run Tools/morning-scheduler.ts
```

---

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Update Goal
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.claude/fitness/workouts.db
INSERT INTO goals (name, goal_type, target_date, target_value, target_unit, start_date, status)
VALUES ('Marathon', 'race', '2026-08-15', 42.2, 'km', date('now'), 'active');
```

### Reload LaunchAgent (after changes)
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.fitness-morning-prescription.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.fitness-morning-prescription.plist
```

### Check ACWR Status
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.claude/fitness/workouts.db "SELECT * FROM v_current_load_status;"
```

### View Compliance
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.claude/fitness/workouts.db "SELECT * FROM v_compliance_summary;"
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Morning Automation
1. **6:00 AM**: LaunchAgent triggers morning-scheduler.ts
2. **Generate**: Prescription engine analyzes recovery, load, periodization
3. **Format**: Creates human-readable Telegram message
4. **Send**: Delivers via Telegram Bot API
5. **Log**: Records success/failure to /tmp/fitness-morning-prescription.log

### Prescription Algorithm
1. **Assess Recovery**: HRV, sleep, body battery → readiness score
2. **Calculate Load**: ACWR (acute:chronic workload ratio) → injury risk
3. **Determine Phase**: Base/Build/Peak/Taper → workout type priorities
4. **Select Template**: Filter by constraints, score by fit, pick optimal
5. **Validate Safety**: Check ACWR limits, recovery requirements

### Learning Loop
- Tracks completion rates per template
- Adjusts difficulty based on "too hard"/"too easy" feedback
- Learns day/time preferences from completion patterns
- Adapts intensity based on recovery impact

## 🚨 Safety Features

**Hard Stops (override everything):**
- ACWR > 1.5 → REST or easy only
- HRV < 85% baseline → No intensity
- Body battery < 30 → REST
- Composite score < 60 → REST

**Progressive Warnings:**
- ACWR 1.3-1.5 → Easy workouts only
- Recovery < 75 → No hard workouts
- < 2 days since last hard → No intensity

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Decision Fatigue Elimination:**
- Before: 30 min planning per workout
- After: 5 seconds ("do the workout")
- **Result: 99.7% reduction**

**Target Compliance:** 85%+ adherence to prescriptions

**Injury Prevention:** ACWR monitoring prevents >50% of overuse injuries
